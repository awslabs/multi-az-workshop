Many customer run their workloads in highly available, multi-Availability Zone (AZ) configurations. These architectures perform well during binary failure events, but often encounter problems with "gray failures". These types of failures' manifestations can be subtle and defy quick and definitive detection. This workshop will demonstrate: 

1. How to build architectures than can contain failures to a single AZ
2. How to detect single AZ impairments
3. How to mitigate their impacts when they occur
