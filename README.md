## Advanced Multi-AZ Resilience Patterns
### Building, operating, and testing resilient multi-AZ applications
In this workshop you will build, operate, and test a resilient multi-AZ application. You will use Amazon CloudWatch to observe the health of your application. You'll inject faults using the AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS) to simulate a variety of single AZ impairments. You'll also learn how to leverage AWS CodeDeploy to perform zonal deployments and experience deployment failures. Finally, you'll leverage Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) zonal shift to recover from these failures.

You can access the workshop through [Workshop Studio](https://catalog.workshops.aws/multi-az-gray-failures/en-US/introduction). The workhop is also available in Japanese.

## Content
The workshop content that you can deploy in your own account is found in the [releases](https://github.com/awslabs/multi-az-workshop/releases) section or can be downloaded from the [on your own](https://catalog.workshops.aws/multi-az-gray-failures/en-US/prerequisites/on-your-own) section of the workshop instructions. New releases are manually pushed to Workshop Studio, which then creates a new release in this repo.
